# Demon-Core
The objective of this project is to investigate the behaviour of the (neutron) diffusion equation in 2 dimensions and implement various boundary conditions such as Dirichlet, Robin/mixed and Neumann boundary conditions. An in-depth derivation of the diffusion equation and its boundary conditions can be found in the notebook.


## Run the project
This project was created using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install), a scientific python IDE which is availablie for all operating systems (Mac, Windows and Linux distros). For Mac and Windows users, I highly recommend downloading Jupyter Notebooks through the [Anaconda Navigator](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id3). For Linux users, I recommend installing it with ```pip``` or ```pip3``` .
